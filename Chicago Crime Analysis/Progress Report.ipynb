    "Project is about the crime analysis in Chicago area. Based on the different house prices of different neighborhoods and the crime occurrence in those areas, our goal is to show that that there is co-relation between the crime rates and house prices. So far we analyzed chicago crime data and median sale price of neighborhood in Chicago. House prices in neighborhoods of Chicago give us an idea about the economic condition of that neighborhood. Now, we are investigating to find out if there is any relation between average income and crime rate.\n"

After that we discussed to collect house price of chicago neighborhood. We collected data from Redfin. Currently we are facing one problem which is to calculate crime rate. We need population of chicago neighborhood to calculate crime rate."

    "\n",
    "In our project we are using two datasets: Chicago Crime Data and House Prices Data.\n",

    "**Chicago Crime Data**:\n",
    "This dataset contains the criminal offences occurred in Chicago from 2001-2019. However, we are going to use crime data in 2012-2019. Each record in this dataset represents the details of a crime that happened in Chicago. The details include the time, type, description, location etc. of the crime. However, we are only going to use time and location of every crime. In this dataset, the neighborhood or the zipcode of the location of the crime is not given. Since, our goal is to analyze the crime happening in Chicago based on different areas and their relationship with the economy of those areas, we had to extract the neighborhoods from the location given in coordinates. We used the **ArcGIS** API to extract the neighborhoods. However, it is taking a huge amount of time to extract the neighborhoods with ArcGIS API. Although our whole dataset contains more than 2 million records, we are currently experimenting with half a million. We will use the whole dataset before our final submission. The function used for extracting the neighborhood data is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**House Prices Data from Redfin**:\n",
    "Redfin provides the data of home sale prices from 2012-2019. Each record represents a 90-day period. Each row includes median sale price, median price per square foot, median listed price, number of houses sold within that 90-day period in a particular neighborhood.\n",
    "We are going to relate our 2 datasets using their neighborhood.\n",

    "### Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "One of our hypotheses is that house price is correlated with the number of crime in a region. We have aggregated the price(per square feet) for each region by each year from 2012 to 2018. Then we plot this information in a lineplot to see the trends of the price change from year to year. For the crime data, we aggregated the number of crime by region and year. Then we plot that data to see the trend of number of crime changed for each region. As we have discussed before, we do not have all the data necessary for crime plotting so our plot of crime data is somewhat incomplete. The reason we thing this hypothesis is important is that, it will show how crime rate is changing throughout the Chicago city with the changing economic landscape. The functions and the plotting for some example region are given here."

    "Finding correct data was hard. However the hardest part was to extract neighborhood data from the crime reports. We have tried multiple APIs to extract that information. Google Maps API was our first choice but it was too costly. Later we had to resort to **ArcGIS** to find the neighborhood. \n",
